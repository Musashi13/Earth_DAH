# Earth_DAH

**D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **H**umanity

## A network that runs on **P**o**R** (**P**roof of **R**estoration) and **P**o**I** (**P**roof of **I**mpact)

A network incentivizing inhabitants of planet Earth to restore her to a healthy state

With a gamified framework we will make it fun to level up in the game of restoring planet Earth

*From each according to their own ability, to each according to their own needs, they may restore Earth and hearts*

### Possible **P**roofs of **R**estoration
- Concensed, weighed pollutants at whitelisted weigh station
- Concensed, numbered items counted by whitelisted recycling center
- Time measured by AI on-chain in epochs (starts when token minted; ends when token burned) and verified by weight (reflected in volume and impact time calculated by AI and algorithmic equation) rewarded with ***TRASH*** token
- Multipliers for working with multiple people
 
### Possible **P**roofs of **I**mpact
- Provide resources for whitelisted restoration projects
- 

### ERC-721s

- Founder flute (SEEDS)- *8 flutes; physical and NFT*
- Super supporter (ROOTS)- *1 flute NFT with 13 Layers~* **ASYNC ART**
- CRAFT is the root of the craft/experience/skills tree that gives access to claim your role of your particular craft that you provide to the community/ecosystem
  1. MUSIC
  2. TEXTILE
  3. PERFORM
  4. DEV
  5. ART
  6. WRITE
  7. 

**TRASH**

- Grocery bag
- Plastic bottle
- Nylon fishing line
- Paper cup
- Plastic straw
- 

W = weight | T = time | P = # of people | T = payout in TRASH

##              W / T * P = T

*The bigger the pile the stronger the magic*

### Gamification

- Each trash items collected in the real world represent a resource in the game 
- The items usage in game represents how much of that item is most prevalent in the real world environment
- If there is more in the real world, it will be a more prevalent item in game and have more use case for smaller objectives
- If there is very little in the environment, it will be used less in the game for larger objectives

#### In-game Items (corresponds to real world items)

- Grocery bag
- Plastic bottle
- Nylon fishing line
- Paper cup
- Plastic straw
- 

### Possible Partnerships

- MetaGame
  1. MG owns and runs recyling facility for plastics to be recycled and used in 3-D printers for MG products in the real world such as recycled skatedecks and wheels or Nova figurines, recycled building materials, or textiles like recycled fabrics to be used by MetaFactory.
  2. MG takes in TRASH nft and recycles it giving the user PFUEL to be used in 4-D printers in game. PFUEL fuels the 4-D printers to produce a pixel block or build a wall, or any other item; even hot-dog can be made with PFUEL.
- Plastic Bank
  1. Utilized their facilities as whitelisted recycle centers
  2. Utilize their partnerships for premium value plastics sales
  3. Partner with MG to utilize their recycling facilities with a 3-D Meta printing sector
