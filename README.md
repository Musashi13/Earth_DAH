**D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **H**umanity
## A network that runs on **P**o**R** (**P**roof of **R**estoration) and **P**o**I** (**P**roof of **I**mpact)

A network incentivizing inhabitants of planet Earth to restore her to a healthy state

With a gamified framework we will make it fun to level up in the game of restoring planet Earth

From each according to their own ability, to each according to their own needs, they may restore the Earth

### Possible **P**roofs of **R**estoration
* Concensed, weighed pollutants at whitelisted weigh station
* Concensed, numbered items counted by whitelisted recycling center

### Possible **P**roofs of **I**mpact
* Provide resources for restoration projects
