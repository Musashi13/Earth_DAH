**D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **H**umanity
## A network that runs on **P**o**R** (**P**roof of **R**estoration) and **P**o**I** (**P**roof of **I**mpact)

A network incentivizing inhabitants of planet Earth to restore her to a healthy state

With a gamified framework we will make it fun to level up in the game of restoring planet Earth

From each according to their own ability, to each according to their own needs, they may restore Earth and hearts

### Possible **P**roofs of **R**estoration
* Concensed, weighed pollutants at whitelisted weigh station
* Concensed, numbered items counted by whitelisted recycling center
* Time measured by blockchain in epochs (starts when token is claimed; ends when token burned) and verified by weight (reflected in volume and impact) rewarded with ***CRAFT TRASH token***
 
### Possible **P**roofs of **I**mpact
* Provided resources for whitelisted restoration projects
* 

### NFTs

- Founder flute (SEEDS)- *8 Flutes*
- Super supporter (ROOTS)- *1 flute with 13 Layers~* **ASYNC ART**
- CRAFT is the root of the craft/experience/skills tree that gives access to claim your role of your particular craft that you provide to the community/ecosystem

### Token

**TRASH**
 1. TRASH
 2. etc
- Weight / time = amount of TRASH token

### Gamification

Each trash items collected in the real world represent a resource in the game 
The items usage in game represents how much of that item is most prevalent in the real world environment
If there is more in the real world, it will be a more prevalent item in game and have more use case for smaller objectives
If there is very little in the environment, it will be used less in the game for larger objectives
